# Startup Brainstorming Crew

Welcome to the Startup Brainstorming Crew project, powered by [crewAI](https://crewai.com). In the notebook, there is a simple multi-agent system built upon CrewAI, LangChain, and Gradio simulating a small startup composed of one master idea generator and three main staffs: a senior technical staff, a senior product manager, and a senior business data analyst. The idea generator comes up with three ideas relevant to the topic of your choice and three main staffs do their portion of tasks regarding each one of those ideas. Please do not forget to use your free Serper API Key. Even by using one of the  light weight open source LLMs of Ollama, I obtain good results. Though feel free to change it to any close source LLM of your choice with the required API Key.
